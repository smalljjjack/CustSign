# CustSign
This is the project I did for hackthon WPI

The main function of this project is to generate customized signature for vistors.

Personally, I beleive a good signature is alwasy helpful for you to leave other a good impression. In some sense, handwriting could display
some personalities. So I want to design this app to help people choose their favorite fonts and use it for their signature.

I collected more than 50 fonts from google font and use bootstrap and my personal css file stylish my user interface.

The function is very easy to understand. You have to tyoe your name in the textarea, and you can choose specific font and font-size to build
signature. And you can also simply use the get random function to get signature with random font. And you can compare different signatures 
in my contianier. After the web generate a signature for you, just simple click the save button. The the app will save this signature in 
the board, then you can compare different fonts and choose you favorite one.
